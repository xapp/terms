Terms of Use

---

Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the software application (the "App") made available to you by X.app LLC ("X.app", "us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the App is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the App.

By accessing or using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the App.

Subscriptions

Some parts of the App are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

If you choose to buy a subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.

Free Trial

X.app may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").

At any time and without notice, X.app reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

---

Fee Changes

X.app, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

X.app will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Refunds

All purchases are final. We cannot issue refunds for purchases charged to your Apple ID.
